PROSPECTIVE PATHWAYS FOR THE FUTURE ENERGY TRANSITION

In this project I would like to propose a model based on linear programming techniques for the minimization of the electricity cost. However, taking in consideration different uses of renewable energies with optimal strategies. In other words, I will try to find the optimal mix of different resources contributing to the total demand of electricity in a certain region.
